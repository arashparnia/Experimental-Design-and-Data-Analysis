## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. R Markdown files permit you to interweave R code with ordinary text to produce well-formatted data analysis reports that are easy to modify. The R Markdown file itself shows the readers exactly how you got the results in your report.
For more details on using R Markdown see [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 
Inline R code: for the build-in R dataset `cars`, there were `r nrow(cars)` 
cars studied. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Equations

You can also include \LaTeX\ equations in your report:
inline $\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x)$ and 
in the display mode:
$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$
 
### Footnotes

Here is the use of a footnote^[This is a footnote.]. 

### Tables

It is also easy to make table by using knit's `kable` function:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5,],caption="A knit kable.")
```

## Exercise 1

### 1.1 Some R-commands

```{r}
x=rep(c("A","B"),each=5); x
sample(x)
rbinom(10,1,0.5)
rbinom(10,1,0.5)
rbinom(5,1,0.8)
x=rnorm(100)
```

The same code chunk but with all the output collapsed into signle block.

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
x=rep(c("A","B"),each=5); x
sample(x)
rbinom(10,1,0.5)
rbinom(10,1,0.5)
rbinom(5,1,0.8)
x=rnorm(100)
```




You can arrange for figures to span across the entire page by using 
the `fig.fullwidth` chunk option. Note the use of the `fig.width` and 
`fig.height` chunk options to establish the proportions of the figure. 
Full width figures look much better if their height is minimized.

```{r,fig.fullwidth=TRUE,fig.height=3}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Petal.Length,xlab="Sepal.Length",ylab="Petal.Length")
```

Chunk option `fig.align`  takes values 'left', 'right', or 'center'.

## Exercise 2

### 2.1 T-test

Below we perform a one sample t-test for the artificial date 
(that we generated ourselves).

```{r}
mu=0.2
x=rnorm(100,mu,1) # creating artificial data
t.test(x,mean=0)   # t.test(x,alternative=c("two.sided"),conf.level=0.95,mu=10)
```

 
Of course, we often do not need to report the whole output of R-commands, only certain
values of the output. For example, below we perform a two-smaple t-test and report 
only the value of t-statistics and the p-pavue.

```{r}
mu=0;nu=0.5
x=rnorm(50,mu,1); y=rnorm(50,nu,1) # creating artificial data
ttest=t.test(x,y) 
```

The value of t-statistics in the above evaluation is  `r round(ttest[[1]],2)` and the p-value is `r round(ttest[[3]],4)`.
  


EXERCISE 1
If you place the file assign1.RData in your R-directory and type
load(file="assign1.RData")
you will have data vectors x1, x2,..., x5 in your R working directory. Make a histogram and a QQ-plot for each of them, and decide which ones could have been sampled from a normal distribution. Experiment by simulating some normal samples of similar sizes and looking at their QQ-plots, before you make up your mind!

```{r}
load(file="assign1.RData")

```
### 1.2 Figures

You can control the size and placement of figures. For example, 
you can put two figures (or more) next to each other. 
Use `par(mfrow=c(n,m))` to create `n` by `m` plots in one picture in R.
You can adjust the proportions of figures using the `fig.width` 
and `fig.height` chunk options. These are specified in inches, 
and will be automatically scaled down to fit within the handout margin.


```{r,fig.margin = TRUE,fig.width=6,fig.height=3}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(x1); qqnorm(x1)
hist(x2); qqnorm(x2)
hist(x3); qqnorm(x3)
hist(x4); qqnorm(x4)
hist(x5); qqnorm(x5)
```
